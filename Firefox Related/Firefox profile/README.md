## Set up Firefox profile on Windows
- Download Firefox ESR (ff)
- Make sure none of the browser window is opened
- Windows > Start > Run
- Under the Run window, type ```firefox -p``` to open the profile settings page
- You will see there is already one profile called __Default__ in the panel; the ff browser uses this __Default__ profile and opens a window when there is no other profile chosen/available
- Click __Create Profile__ to make a new profile
- Follow the step, give it a name of the profile (i.e. Testing), and complete the creation
- Back to the profile settings page, a new profile is created and shown in the panel
- Select the checkbox _Use the selected profile without asking at startup_ if necessary

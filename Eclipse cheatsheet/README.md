## Useful Eclipse settings
There are some useful tricks that makes using Eclipse easier.  
- For Git users, enable file tracing from other location <br />
Say I have an Eclipse project, and I want to know whether a file is edited from other editors/IDEs or not...

  `Windows > Preferences > General > Workspace`

  Enable checkbox _Refresh using native hooks and polling_ and _Refresh on access_

- Replace tabs with white spaces

  `Windows > Preferences > General > Editors > Text Editors`

  Change the number of spaces for a tab by modifying _Displayed tab width_;

  Enable checkbox _Insert spaces for tabs_
